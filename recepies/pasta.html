    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
         <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
         <li>½ cup chopped green onions</li>
         <li>1 anchovy fillet</li>
         <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
         <li>2 zucchini - alternating strips of peel removed lengthwise and zucchini sliced</li>
         <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
         <li>2 cups tomato sauce</li>
         <li>¾ cup chicken stock</li>
         <li>1 pinch white sugar (Optional)</li>
         <li>1 cup seeded and sliced jalapeno peppers</li>
         <li>1 cup seeded and sliced red Fresno chile peppers</li>
         <li>½ cup seeded and sliced yellow mini bell pepper</li>
         <li>½ cup seeded and sliced orange mini bell pepper</li>
         <li>2 teaspoons freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
         <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, divided</li>
         <li>2 teaspoons freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Place heavy skillet over medium heat and pour olive oil into hot skillet; add green onions and anchovy fillet. Cook and stir until anchovy breaks down and green onions are tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Add garlic to skillet and cook until translucent, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Stir zucchini into green onion mixture; cook, stirring occasionally, until zucchini slices just start to become tender, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle with salt and black pepper; cook until zucchini centers start to change color to slightly green, 1 to 2 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour tomato sauce and chicken stock into skillet. Reduce heat to low; add sugar. Mix jalapeno, Fresno, yellow mini pepper, and orange mini pepper rings into mixture. Bring sauce to a simmer and reduce heat to low.</li>
        <li>Pour rotelle pasta into boiling water and cook, stirring often, until pasta is still slightly firm, about 7 minutes. Drain and let pasta stand for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Bring sauce to a boil; stir in rotelle pasta. Reduce heat to medium. Cook, stirring often, until pasta, zucchini, and peppers are tender, 2 to 3 more minutes. Taste and adjust levels of salt and black pepper. Mix in about 1 1/2 teaspoon parsley. Serve in bowls and top with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and remaining 1/2 teaspoon parsley.</li>
    </ol>
